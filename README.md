# Customer-Sentimental-Analysis
# Project Overview
- This project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify distinct customer segments and provide actionable insights for the marketing team. By leveraging machine learning, specifically the KMeans clustering algorithm, the project categorizes customers based on their behavior and characteristics. This segmentation helps the marketing team target specific customer groups effectively and strategize for higher conversion rates. The project utilizes an open-source dataset and includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations in customer data.

## Objective
- To segment customers based on their spending behavior, income, and other features. 
- To identify potential target customers who are likely to convert easily. 
- To provide the marketing team with a data-driven understanding of customer segments to design better marketing strategies. 

## Tech Stack Used
- Programming Language: Python 
- Libraries for EDA: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn 
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn 
- Visualization Tools: matplotlib, seaborn 
- Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
- Data Collection: Used an open-source dataset with customer details like income, spending scores, and demographics. 
- EDA: Cleaned and preprocessed data, handled missing values, analyzed distributions, and identified correlations using visualizations such as heatmaps and scatterplots. 
- Feature Engineering: Normalized features to improve clustering performance. 
- Clustering: Applied the KMeans algorithm for customer segmentation, determining the optimal clusters using the Elbow Method and silhouette scores. 
- Evaluation: Analyzed clusters to identify target groups and provided insights into spending behavior, income distribution, and customer preferences for strategic  marketing.
- ## Key Insights
Patterns and correlations identified during EDA revealed distinct customer behaviors. 
Clustering helped uncover actionable insights for segmenting the customer base. 
Data-driven recommendations can help optimize marketing efforts and enhance revenue generation. 
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and machine learning in understanding customer behavior and provides a foundation for targeted and effective marketing strategies. 
## Recommendations
Focus on high-conversion potential clusters with tailored marketing campaigns, especially targeting high spenders with low income. 
Offer personalized product recommendations to high-income, low-spending customers to boost engagement. 
Develop affordable products for low-income clusters with spending potential and refine strategies based on ongoing data analysis.
