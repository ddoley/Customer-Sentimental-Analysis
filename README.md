# Customer-Sentimental-Analysis
# Project Overview
- This project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify distinct customer segments and provide actionable insights for the marketing team. By leveraging machine learning, specifically the KMeans clustering algorithm, the project categorizes customers based on their behavior and characteristics. This segmentation helps the marketing team target specific customer groups effectively and strategize for higher conversion rates. The project utilizes an open-source dataset and includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations in customer data.

## Objective
- To segment customers based on their spending behavior, income, and other features. 
- To identify potential target customers who are likely to convert easily. 
- To provide the marketing team with a data-driven understanding of customer segments to design better marketing strategies. 

## Tech Stack Used
- Programming Language: Python 
- Libraries for EDA: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn 
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn 
- Visualization Tools: matplotlib, seaborn 
- Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
Data Collection: Used an open-source dataset containing customer information such as income, spending scores, and demographic details.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
Analyzed statistical distributions and identified correlations between features.
Visualized relationships between variables using heatmaps, scatterplots, and histograms to uncover patterns.
Feature Engineering:
Normalized features to ensure better clustering performance.
Clustering Using KMeans:
Implemented the KMeans algorithm to group customers into clusters based on their characteristics.
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and silhouette scores.
Evaluation:
Interpreted cluster characteristics and identified potential target groups for the marketing team.
Provided insights into spending behavior, income distribution, and customer preferences.
## Recommendations
Focus marketing strategies on customers identified in specific clusters with high conversion potential.
Introduce tailored marketing campaigns to target high spenders (even those with low income) to boost sales.
Offer personalized product recommendations for high-income customers who currently spend less to encourage higher engagement.
Develop more affordable products for low-income clusters with significant spending potential.
Continuously monitor and analyze new data to refine clusters and adapt strategies to changing customer behavior.
## Key Insights
Patterns and correlations identified during EDA revealed distinct customer behaviors.
Clustering helped uncover actionable insights for segmenting the customer base.
Data-driven recommendations can help optimize marketing efforts and enhance revenue generation.
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and machine learning in understanding customer behavior and provides a foundation for targeted and effective marketing strategies.
